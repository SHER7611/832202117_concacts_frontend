- **HTML**: For building the page structure.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing front-end interactions and logic.

## Coding Style

### HTML
- Use lowercase for all tags.
- Attribute values should be wrapped in double quotes `"`.
- Each element should end on its own line to keep the code clean and readable.
- Comments should use the `<!-- Comment -->` format and be concise.

### CSS
- Selectors, properties, and values should use lowercase letters.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Add a blank line after each rule set for better readability.
- Separate properties with a new line.
- Each CSS file should end with a `.css` extension and be named using lowercase letters, with words separated by hyphens.

### JavaScript
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Declare variables with `const` and `let`, and avoid using `var`.
- Leave a blank line between each function.
- Use arrow functions `()=>{}` for defining anonymous functions.
- Each JavaScript file should end with a `.js` extension and be named using lowercase letters, with words separated by hyphens.

## File Naming
- All file names should be in lowercase, with words separated by hyphens `-`.
- HTML file should be named `contacts.html`.
- CSS file should be named `styles.css`.
- JavaScript file should be named `script.js`.

## Comments
- Necessary comments should be included in the code to explain complex logic or methods.
- Comments should be written in complete sentences for better understanding.

## Other Conventions
- Maintain code readability by avoiding complex nesting.
- Each file should contain only one main function or module to avoid becoming too large.
